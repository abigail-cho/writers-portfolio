# Context

This article explained how to add [Google UTM parameters](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) to affiliate links that customers generated within this company's platform. It was assumed that customers were only somewhat familiar with UTM parameters and wanted to learn more about how to use them for their marketing campaigns that they ran within this company's platform. Because this article was only available to customers, any proprietary information has been redacted, and screenshots of the platform have been removed. Original styling and text have been kept the same. I was the primary contributor to this article.

# Adding UTM Parameters 

You can add **UTM Parameters** to your affiliate links to further track data and learn about your customers. In general, **UTM parameters** are tags that can be added to the ends of URLs that can then be tracked in an analytics tool such as **Google Analytics.** Every time the URL is used with the UTM parameters, you can track data about that URL depending on the type of UTM parameter you set up. Some examples of UTM parameters you might set up for your affiliate link groups are:
* `utm_source`: Identifies where the URL's traffic came from 
* `utm_medium`: Identifies how the URL's traffic was generated
* `utm_campaign`: Identifies the campaign for which the URL's traffic was generated

Once you choose your UTM parameters, you must then assign each parameter a **value**. A parameter's value is what is tracked for its corresponding parameter whenever the URL used. For example, using the parameters above:
* A `utm_source`'s value could be **Instagram**
* A `utm_medium`'s value could be the **creator's name** or **Instagram handle**
* A `utm_campaign`'s value could be your **creator marketing program's handle**

Putting all the examples above together, an example of a URL with UTM parameters is:

```https://████.co/?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=████&utm_campaign=summer2020```

Then, each time a user clicks on that link, your analytics tool will register that the user came to ```https://████.co``` from Instagram via the Instagram handle @████ in association with a Summer 2020 campaign. 

If you have more questions about UTM parameters, you can learn more about them directly from Google Analytics' help article [Collect campaign data with custom URLs](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863?hl=en#parameters&zippy=%2Cin-this-article).

By adding UTM parameters to your affiliate link groups, you can track data about which creators are generating the most traffic, from where your traffic is coming from, or for what creator marketing program the traffic was generated for. Be sure to take advantage of UTM parameters in your affiliate link groups to get the most out of your creator marketing programs! 

## What You'll Need 

* An existing **affiliate link group.** For more information on creating affiliate link groups, see our help article ████████ █████████ █████.
