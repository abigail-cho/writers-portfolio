# Context

This is an informational understanding-oriented article that explained (1) what first-party data was to influencers and (2) how giving the company, GRIN, access to their first-party data was beneficial to them. It was assumed that influencers were not familiar with first-party data at all, and that they were cautious about giving access to their social media data directly to GRIN. This article not only aimed to demystify first-party data, but convince influencers to give GRIN permission to access their data. 

This article was publicly available since my time at this company, so I have not redacted any of the content. The current version can be viewed [here](https://help.grin.co/docs/understanding-first-party-data). I was the primary contributor to the version shown below.

# Understanding First-Party Data 

**First-party data** is user data collected with permission directly from users on websites and applications based on how they interact with the platform. This data is called "first-party" because businesses get the data straight from their users. In GRIN's case, we receive first-party data from your connected **social networks.** These networks share data with GRIN to display information about your posts and feeds directly to your collaborating brands. These include: 
* Your content 
* Content metrics 
* Your audience demographic information where available, such as gender 

Social networks can only share this data with GRIN with your permission. GRIN and brands **do not** receive permission to: 
* Share information about your collaborations with other brands, including payout or terms information 
* Access your account passwords 
* Post on your behalf
* View your private messages 

In contrast, **third-party data** is acquired without a direct relationship between the business and the user whose data is being collected. Third-party data is bought and sold through a marketplace or exchange—sometimes without your permission. Because of this, using third-party data creates privacy concerns for users. 

GRIN is shifting away from third-party data and will be using exclusively first-party data to pull in creator content and metrics. You can learn more about how GRIN works with your first-party data below. 

## Benefits of First-Party Data 

There are a variety of benefits to using first-party data rather than third-party data for both you, the creator, and your collaborating brand. One of the most important benefits is that first-party data is collected straight from the source—which, in this case, are you and your social network accounts. With first-party data, the content and metrics GRIN shares to your brands will be as up-to-date and accurate as possible. This ensures you’ll be reimbursed for your work, as well as builds trust between you and the brand. Brands that can rely on precise metrics are also more likely to collaborate with you again. In contrast, using third-party data has a risk of being outdated or inaccurate.

A second benefit is that using first-party data allows you to control who can access your data. The practice of collecting third-party data from users and selling that data has raised a variety of privacy concerns. By leveraging first-party data, you can feel more secure about your privacy as well as be assured that your information goes straight to your brand without any middlemen in between. This means you won’t have to worry about others buying and selling your data without your knowledge—and potentially profiting off of it without your consent.

## Using First-Party Data with GRIN 

To take advantage of first-party data, you need to connect each of your social network accounts on your **Live URL.** The process to get your permission is different for each network. For some, we only need you to provide your username, and we’ll get permission directly from the social network to access your content and metrics. For others, you’ll need to grant permission yourself by **authenticating** your accounts.

**Authentication** means that you’ll need to provide your username and also go through an additional, secure process confirming that GRIN has your permission to collect your data. During this process, you typically need to accept one or more permissions. You **must** accept **all permissions** that appear during the authentication process; these are the minimum permissions GRIN needs to sync your content, stats, and information.

If a social network does require you to authenticate, then your content and metrics from that network won’t appear in GRIN or to your brand until you do, even if you provide your username. We **highly recommend** you authenticate so all your posts and metrics seamlessly sync for your brands.

If you don’t authenticate, you’ll need to manually upload your content, captions, and stats each time
you want to submit a deliverable.
