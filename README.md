# writers-portfolio
My portfolio of past documentation I've written. 

This portfolio has a mixture of publicly available documentation and private documentation with proprietary information redacted from my previous positions. Each sample has been converted to GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) with all original styling perserved for consistency across all samples, further maintain brand anonymity, capture the version of the article that I primarily contributed to, and let me provide the context for each sample at the beginning of each one.
