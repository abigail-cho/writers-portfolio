# Context

This is a procedural goal-oriented article that explained how to add [Google UTM parameters](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) to affiliate links that customers generated within this company's platform. It was assumed that customers were influencer marketing managers who were just starting their campaigns, and they were only somewhat familiar with UTM parameters. 

Because this article was only available to customers, any proprietary information has been redacted, and screenshots of the platform have been removed. Original styling and text have been kept the same. I was the primary contributor to this article.

# Adding UTM Parameters 

You can add **UTM Parameters** to your affiliate links to further track data and learn about your customers. In general, **UTM parameters** are tags that can be added to the ends of URLs that can then be tracked in an analytics tool such as **Google Analytics.** Every time the URL is used with the UTM parameters, you can track data about that URL depending on the type of UTM parameter you set up. Some examples of UTM parameters you might set up for your affiliate link groups are:
* `utm_source`: Identifies where the URL's traffic came from 
* `utm_medium`: Identifies how the URL's traffic was generated
* `utm_campaign`: Identifies the campaign for which the URL's traffic was generated

Once you choose your UTM parameters, you must then assign each parameter a **value**. A parameter's value is what is tracked for its corresponding parameter whenever the URL used. For example, using the parameters above:
* A `utm_source`'s value could be **Instagram**
* A `utm_medium`'s value could be the **creator's name** or **Instagram handle**
* A `utm_campaign`'s value could be your **creator marketing program's handle**

Putting all the examples above together, an example of a URL with UTM parameters is:

```https://████.co/?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=████&utm_campaign=summer2020```

Then, each time a user clicks on that link, your analytics tool will register that the user came to ```https://████.co``` from Instagram via the Instagram handle @████ in association with a Summer 2020 campaign. 

If you have more questions about UTM parameters, you can learn more about them directly from Google Analytics' help article [Collect campaign data with custom URLs](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863?hl=en#parameters&zippy=%2Cin-this-article).

By adding UTM parameters to your affiliate link groups, you can track data about which creators are generating the most traffic, from where your traffic is coming from, or for what creator marketing program the traffic was generated for. Be sure to take advantage of UTM parameters in your affiliate link groups to get the most out of your creator marketing programs! 

## What You'll Need 

* An existing **affiliate link group.** For more information on creating affiliate link groups, see our help article ████████ █████████ █████.
* An **analytics tool** to track your UTM parameters. We recommend using **Google Analytics.** For more information on setting up analytics with Google Analytics, see Google Analytics' help article [Build new segments](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3124493?hl=en&ref_topic=3123779#create&zippy=%2Cin-this-article).

> **Note**
>
> Be sure you have an analytics tool ready to set up to track the UTM parameters you create for your affiliate link groups! Even if you add the UTM parameters to your affiliate links, you won't be able to track any data about the parameters unless you have a tracking tool such as Google Analytics.

## How to Do It 

1. Navigate to ██████. This will open your ██████ page. 

<p align="center">[Image highlighting where to click on the main navigation menu]</p>

2. Click **Affiliate Links** on the ██████ whose affiliate link group you'd like to add UTM parameters to. This will open a list of your ██████'s affiliate link groups.

3. Click **Edit █████** over the affiliate link group you want to add UTM parameters to.

<p align="center">[Image highlighting the <b>Edit</b> button]</p>

4. Click ████ █. ███ ███████. 

<p align="center">[Image highlighting the page to click on]</p>

5. Under ███████████ ███ ██████████, click ███ █████████. This will add a new field where you can enter UTM parameters and values.

6. Enter a **UTM parameter** in the ███ field (for example, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, or `utm_campaign`).

7. Enter a **value** for the UTM parameter in the █████ field. 

<p align="center">[Image highlighting which field to enter the value]</p>

> **Note**
>
> We recommend using █████████ for values when you are able so your affiliate link group will automatically update your value when you assign it to a creator. For example, if you use the ████████████ variable, then ████████ affiliate links for creators named Sarah Jones and John Smith, their ██████ affiliate links will █████████████ ██████ ██ have "Sarah" or "John" in █████ ██████████ ████. This way, you can track █████ █████████ ████ (Sarah or John, in this case) generated traffic on your site without ██████ ██ ████████ █ ███ ████ ███ ████ ███████. 
> <p align="center">[Image highlighting where to click to add these values]<p>
> Values are also case sensitive, meaning values like "████" or "████" will be tracked as two different ones. Generally, it's best practice to keep your values lowercase when you're able. If not, but sure you case your values consistently!

8. If you want to add another UTM parameter, click ███ █████████.

<p align="center">[Image highlighting the button to click to add another pair of UTM parameter and value]

9. Repeat **Steps 6 and 7** for each UTM parameter you add. 

> **Note** 
> 
> You can't have more than one of each type of UTM parameter per URL. For example, you can't have two `utm_source`s in one URL. However, you can add each unique UTM parameter in any order you want. There are five different types of UTM parameters, which means you can have up to five UTM parameters in one URL if you use each of them.

10. Click ████.

That's it! Your affiliate link group is now updated with UTM parameters. Now, you're ready to track your affiliate links in an analytics tool and gather even more data about your creator marketing programs.
