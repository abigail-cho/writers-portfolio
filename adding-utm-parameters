# Adding UTM Parameters 

You can add **UTM Parameters** to your affiliate links to further track data and learn about your customers. In general, **UTM parameters** are tags that can be added to the ends of URLs that can then be tracked in an analytics tool such as **Google Analytics.** Every time the URL is used with the UTM parameters, you can track data about that URL depending on the type of UTM parameter you set up. Some examples of UTM parameters you might set up for your affiliate link groups are:
* `utm_source`: Identifies where the URL's traffic came from 
* `utm_medium`: Identifies how the URL's traffic was generated
* `utm_campaign`: Identifies the campaign for which the URL's traffic was generated
